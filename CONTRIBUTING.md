# Contributing to /dev/push

- Support development by sponsoring the author: https://github.com/sponsors/hunvreus
- Submit pull requests (PRs) against the `development` branch, not `main`.
- For branches:
  - `main` is the production and default branch.
  - `development` is for staging.
  - New features are worked in `feature/name-of-the-feature` branches.
  - Issues are addressed in `issue/123-main-isse` branches.
  - When ready, we PR against `development`, test it and then finally merge to `main`.
- Keep changes focused: one feature or fix per PR.
- Test locally before submitting.
- Follow existing code style.

Thanks for helping!
